# Bot: the simplest Top + Bottom lattice

This is a bare-bones STLC with the top and bottom
types added. It's a great way to study the essence of
subtyping without any of the noise coming from actual
subtype checks.

Note that Exercise 17.3.2 asks students to add Bot to
the more-complex rcdsub record-subtyping implementation;
one way to do this is to unify the evaluation and subtyping
logic here with what's in the rcdsub codebase.

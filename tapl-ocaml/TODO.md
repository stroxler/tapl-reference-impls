Where I am right now:
- Get through Chapters 15 and 16 on subtyping
- Then either start on recursive types or on polymorphism

Things to come back to:
- Add examples of variant types to fullsimple's sample code
- Add examples of try/with to fullerror's sample code
- Maybe add some notes on the implementation of record
  and variant handling for both type and runtime evaluation.
- Revisit fullref after reading the Chapter 15 code, so I
  can look at it with an eye toward subtyping.
